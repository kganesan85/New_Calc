I have followed Shunting Yard Algorithm:

The shunting yard algorithm is stack-based. Infix expressions are the form of mathematical notation most people are used to, for instance 3+4 or 3+4*1. For the conversion there are two text variables (strings), the input and the output. There is also a stack that holds operators not yet added to the output queue. To convert, the program reads each symbol in order and does something based on that symbol.
